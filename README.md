## ðŸš€ How to Run with Docker

> This will spin up the Web API and MySQL database locally.

### âœ… Step 1: Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Ensure ports `8081` (API) and `3307` (MySQL) are free

### âœ… Step 2: Run the app

```bash
docker compose down -v          # Clean up previous containers and data
docker compose up --build       # Build and run API + MySQL
```
âœ… Step 3: Test the API
Once running, visit:
http://localhost:8081/books
You should see a JSON array of book entries.

 ðŸ“‚ Sample Data
ðŸ“„ Books.sql: Initializes the Books database and creates the books table with 5 sample entries.
ðŸ“„ Books.xml: Sample book entries in XML format.
ðŸ“„ Books.xsd: XML schema file for validation.
SQL is automatically executed on first startup via Docker volume bind.
